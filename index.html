          One of the most surprising questions ever broached by my father
          occurred when I was in my 20s and on break from college. He asked if
          growing up in Vermont had been an okay experience for me. This was so
          out of character in so many ways and I was somewhat shocked by the
          question. I asked him to elaborate. He said that he was concerned
          about how rural it was and the potential lack of opportunities for
          learning about the world. He explained the pros and cons he and my
          mother had discussed before making that move (we made some big moves
          throughout my childhood) and he was curious to know, I think, how
          their decision had impacted my life. I reassured him that I had loved
          it there and our conversation moved on. That question has stuck with
          me over the years, though, because I don't think I understood at that
          point how deeply growing up in the woods in Charlotte shaped who I am
          and how I experience the world.

          Fast forward to 2018-ish and a random interaction with some St. Louis
          friends during their vacation in the Northeast. They were driving
          through Vermont, stopping at stores and various sight-seeing points,
          and felt compelled to send me a text that read something like:
          "Driving through VT. We understand you so much better now!" I, of
          course, called them and asked them what they meant by that. They
          referenced homemade jam and wool festivals and mountains and lakes,
          and I laughed and responded - yep.
        </p>

          In 2020, during lockdown, a group of friends and I started a zoom meet
          where we would give presentations to each other on any subject we
          desired. For my first presentation I chose to share the things that I
          loved about Vermont. By this point I was deep diving into my Vermont
          experiences and what I believe I took away from them...

          <h2 id="headingTwo">A respect for, and love of, nature</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          You cannot grow up in Vermont without learning to respect nature.
          Nature is no joke. The winters alone are harsh and bitter cold (the
          record while we lived there was -40Â°F). It was so cold that I would
          try to hold my breath from the door to the car so that my lungs
          wouldn't sting inhaling the air. Eyelashes inevitably froze to each
          other and I'd have to use my twice-gloved fingers to melt them and
          reopen my eyes. My mom ploughed us out of our (mile-long!) driveway so
          that we could go to school and so that she could go to the store. We
          had to stock up on items just in case we got a Nor'easter. It was
          intense.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was also beautiful. There was a day I remember looking out from my
          window and seeing that freezing rain had covered individual branches
          on the treesand bushes of the entire forest. The sun was shining and
          it was a magical glittery wonderland. When it snowed we would invite
          family friends over to build this massive sled run that started at our
          deck and went all the way down our hill with banked turns and trees
          you needed to avoid running into.

          In the spring there was mud. Everywhere. The kind of mud where you
          regularly lost your boot and then had to try to figure out how to get
          it unstuck and back on your foot without letting your sock touch the
          ground. (For more on this topic

          and all kinds of new life.

        <p>
          The summer was hot and muggy with mosquitos the size of a Buick (any
          Annie Hall fans?), but there was also the lake. Lake Champlain was so
          clear and clean and beautiful. With a lake like that, the idea of
          pollution and/or not picking up your trash was absolutely
          unacceptable. I can still smell the crisp air and feel the serenity
          that lake provides deep in my bones.

          And then there's the fall. I used to make fun of the leaf-peepers. I
          thought it was ridiculous that people would travel from hundreds of
          miles away to look at leaves. I had no idea how lucky I was to enjoy
          that scenery as my daily life's backdrop. Those gorgeous hues! The
          experience of nature's timeline made me feel deeply connected to
          existence, the planet and my animal place in it all.

          I'm not sure if it's where we happened to live or what, but Vermont
          was full of creative entrepreneurs (many with food-related endeavors,
          as it turns out). From our family friend, Linda, who tapped her maple
          trees and spent hours boiling the sap down into syrup, to my sister's
          friend's dad, Bob Stiller, who founded Green Mountain Coffee, boutique
          and not-so-boutique businesses were everywhere. People were doing
          things. And the message that I received was: "This is what people do -
          they make things. And if you can think of it, you can find a way to do
          it."
        </p>
        <h3 id="headingThree">Let's start with the obvious: Ben & Jerry's</h3>
        <p>
          In grade school we took a class trip to Waterbury to tour the Ben &
          Jerry's factory. We learned all about how Ben and Jerry met (I still
          vaguely remember the video we watched where one of them asked the
          other's mom if he could come out and play) and about their activism
          through ice cream. We saw the factory in action and got to sample
          flavors. What more could you want? I'll tell you what:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            To try the Vermonster. Unless my memory fails me, back in the late
            80s/early 90s the Vermonster included 1 scoop of EVERY FLAVOR OF ICE
            CREAM (now it only contains 20). It was ENORMOUS. LITERALLY
            <a href="https://www.benjerry.com/whats-new/2014/vermonster-sundaes"
              >A BUCKET OF ICE CREAM SUNDAE</a
            >. Because of this (and because our parents were sane) we were never
            allowed to order it. But I think, assuming I could rally a group of
            20 or so of my closest friends, it could go back on the bucket list
            (no pun intended).
          </li>
          <li>
            To get a vintage B&J's Woody Jackson T-Shirt. This is going to
            happen.
          </li>
          <li>
            To revive the White Russian flavor from the Graveyard. Hands down
            the best milkshake flavor ever.
          </li>

          One of my best friends in grade school was Ellen Lampman. Among other
          things she used to share her pepperoni and cheese snacks and invite me
          to come over to play Zelda on her Nintendo. Ellen's dad owned a
          chocolate factory. He would bring home samples for new recipes and let
          us taste test them. We would have sleepovers and wake up in the middle
          of the night to sneak into her cupboard and help ourselves to more.
          One year, our class got to visit the factory and learn how chocolates
          were made. I have never seen so much chocolate in my life. I remember
          this massive vat with a huge stirring mechanism and all I could think
          about was jumping into that vat and swimming through all of that
          chocolate. Ellen's dad was like a real-life Willy Wonka (without the
          creepy factor). He made happiness for a living. Today, he, Ellen and
          her brother continue their business focusing on fairtrade, sustainable
          sourcing and investing in their community.

          (it looks like they have updated their machinery) and the number of
          apples it takes to make a gallon of cider (just a little over a peck -
          yeah, I absolutely googled that bc there's no way I could remember).
          The fresh cider was out-of-this-world delicious and they made sure
          that the rest of the apple didn't go to waste, which was a great
          lesson that really stuck with me. I can't remember what they said they
          did with the pomace, but I think it was along the lines of compost.
          Now it looks like they turn it into dog treats.
